# Bline

A parametric acid bassline sculptor script for Monome Norns.

![bline main screen](https://github.com/toneburst/bline/blob/main/screenshots/bLINE_screen-01.png)

## Prerequisites:

#### Required

- Original Norns, Norns Shield or Fates

tb-303 emulator should apply accent to received MIDI notes with a high velocity value (accent threshold adjustable) and slide to overlapping notes ("mono-legato" mode).

Other synths that have a mono-legato mode and allow velocity to modulate note volume and filter envelope modulation amount may also produce interesting results. 

#### Recommended

- MIDI controller with multiple sliders, knobs or encoders for parameter-mapping
- Hardware or software tb-303 emulator
- MIDI interface or USB cable to connect to the above

## Quick-Start:

- E1 : Change parameter page
- E2 : Param 1
- E3 : Param 2
- K2 : Toggle parameter group
- K3 : Currently unassigned

Not all parameters are exposed in the UI display. Mapping Params to MIDI controller recommended!

See wiki for more information.

## Future Development

Roadmap for future development includes

- [ ] Additional output modes
- [ ] Updated Quantiser module
- [ ] Additional assignable functions for K3
- [ ] Momentary pattern-transform FX 
- [ ] Grid support for specific parameters (pattern-lengths, offsets, pattern-transform FX)
- [ ] Arc support for key params
- [ ] Preset system (instant save/recall)
- [ ] MIDI file export

This is a personal spare-time project, and I'm a hobbyist programmer, so no guarantees all (or indeed *any*) of these additional features will be implemented.
